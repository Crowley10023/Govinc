  @Architect create a web application with a simple entry page that allows for
  three actions

# Coding Task Summary and Preparation

## 1. Task Summary

**Objective:**  
Create a web application with a simple entry page that allows the user to perform three distinct actions.

## 2. Coding Requirements

- A web application (framework not specified, so clarify if necessary; assume a default, e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js, or React for frontend.)
- A single entry page with UI buttons or links for three different actions.
- Actions are not specified (need clarification on their nature, e.g., navigation, API calls, state changes, etc.).

## 3. Implementation Approach

### a. Choose Basic Stack
- Select a lightweight web framework to quickly scaffold a simple web app.
    - Python (Flask)
    - JavaScript (Node.js/Express or a static frontend like React)

### b. Project Structure (example with Flask/Python)



```
```
/project-root
|-- app.py
|-- templates/
|   |-- entry.html
|-- static/
```



### c. Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Scaffold the application**
    - Set up a main file (e.g., `app.py` for Flask).
    - Set up a basic home route (`/`) to serve the entry page.

2. **Build the Entry Page**
    - Create a HTML template (`/templates/entry.html`) with a simple UI.
    - Add three clearly labeled buttons or links for the three actions.

3. **Implement Actions**
    - Since action details are missing, stub the three actions as separate routes (e.g., `/action1`, `/action2`, `/action3`) or as UI changes (modals, alerts, etc.).
    - Each action should demonstrate distinct behavior (to be defined).

4. **Test**
    - Ensure the entry page loads and all three actions respond.

### d. Example File Paths/URIs

- Main app: `/app.py`
- Entry page template: `/templates/entry.html`
- Route URIs: `/`, `/action1`, `/action2`, `/action3`

## 4. Ambiguities and Clarifications Needed

- What web framework and/or programming language should be used?
- What exactly should the three actions do? (Navigate to new pages, perform calculations, send requests, display messages, etc.)

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Proceed to scaffold the app with stub handlers for the three actions.
- Clarify action details and framework choice if not specified.

---

**For Coding Agent:**  
Start with `/app.py` and `/templates/entry.html`. Implement three distinct action stubs, pending further detail.
