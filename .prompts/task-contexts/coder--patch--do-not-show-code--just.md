**Session Summary for AI Agent Handoff**

### System Context
- The user is managing Java Spring code for compliance calculations and UI display in an org-unit-based compliance system. 
- Requirements focus on correct compliance calculations, list population, aggregation logic, and separation of direct vs. propagated compliance results.

---

## Summary of Requirements & Decisions

### Compliance List/UI

1. **Initial Requirement**
    - The list UI must show the selected org unit’s compliance results in addition to all its children.

2. **Show Org Unit with Results plus Children**
    - The calculation of compliance for this list must ensure:
        - Each row (org unit or child) shows its own (direct) compliance result (not aggregated or propagated).
        - The list must include the org unit and all its descendants (children, grandchildren, etc. — recursive expansion).
        - Implemented by recursively collecting org unit and descendants and computing direct compliance for each.

3. **Direct Assessment Only**
    - Compliance check results in the list must be based solely on direct assessments for each unit—not aggregated from child compliance.

4. **Status Column Label**
    - The “status” field in the UI list should reflect the *correct direct* compliance state for each unit (“Compliant” / “Non-compliant”) based on compliance threshold logic, not on raw scores or any other criterion.

5. **No Short-circuit for 100% Score**
    - Even if a unit's score is 100%, the compliance result must strictly depend on compliance threshold logic (i.e., do not override threshold-based evaluation).

6. **Don't Mix Aggregate with Direct Results**
    - Compliance aggregation (parent determined by children) must *not* override or affect the direct compliance for any particular org unit or child as shown in the UI list/table. The aggregation/propagation logic is needed *only* for global/summary display.

---

### Aggregate/Summary Compliance

7. **Separate Aggregate Compliance Calculation**
    - The top section ("Results for Org Unit: ...") must reflect a boolean AND of compliance status of the org unit and all its descendants (aggregate compliance). That is:
        - The summary “COMPLIANT/NOT COMPLIANT” is based on whether all entries in the expanded list are compliant.
        - This is implemented in `calculateCompliance()` and separated from the direct results list.

---

### Code Changes & File References

**Main file touched/proposed:**  
- `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceService.java`
    - All crucial compliance logic, list aggregation and separation, as well as aggregate summary logic, are implemented here.

**Other files involved:**  
- `app/src/main/resources/templates/compliance-view.html` (for the UI label, but main logic patched in service/controller).
- `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceCheckController.java` (controller may pass the correct objects for UI).

### Decisional Trace
- The list of results now always shows strictly the direct compliance for each org unit and every descendant.
- Compliance propagation logic (for “total” compliance) no longer alters the results in the UI list. It has been isolated to the summary calculation only.
- UI’s “status” always reflects threshold-based compliance (not just score percent).
- The summary (“Results for Org Unit: ...”) is driven by a separate AND-over-all-direct-compliance check.

---

## Current State

- The Java service correctly provides:
    - For UI lists/tables: direct compliance for each org unit and child, obtained recursively.
    - For top summary: AND across compliance of org and all descendants.
- All code for mixing “propagated” compliance into the list has been removed/refactored, per final requirements.
- No tasks are currently pending. The user’s final requirements appear to be satisfied in `ComplianceService.java`.

---

## Next Steps / Pending Actions

- **Review UI & Controller:** Ensure that the controller and UI properly use:
    - The direct compliance list/map for table display.
    - The aggregate compliance result for summary display.
- **Test:** Test both views (direct result list; aggregate summary) with org units of various children/descendants and compliance states to ensure business logic is reflected accurately in the UI.
- **Documentation:** Consider documenting this compliance logic separation for maintainability and for other agents.

### Relevant Unique References

- Logic for compliance calculation: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceService.java`
- UI template likely involved: `app/src/main/resources/templates/compliance-view.html`
- Controller endpoint passing data to UI: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceCheckController.java`

---

**No uncommitted changesets or unresolved conflicts remain in the session.** All logic is now split correctly between direct per-unit compliance (flat, recursive list) and aggregate “all children & self” compliance (for summary). The workflow is ready for further development or UI adjustments.
