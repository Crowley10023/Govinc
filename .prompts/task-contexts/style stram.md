**Session Summary (for AI Agents)**

**Context:**  
The session involved refactoring the file app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html and its associated CSS in app/src/main/resources/static/style.css for a web application supporting assessments. The overarching aim was to standardize UI behavior, improve maintainability, and organize JavaScript.

---

**User Requirements:**
1. **CSS Refactor:**  
   - Extract all inline CSS from assessment-details.html and move it into style.css.
   - Section the extracted CSS clearly within style.css.

2. **Buttons & Modals Consistency:**  
   - Three buttons ("Choose Org Unit", "Choose Users", "Choose Org Services") and their popups must use identical layout, styling, and modal/popup UX (matching the layout of the "Choose Users" modal).
   - Markup/classes and modal structure must be unified across all three selectors.

3. **JavaScript Organization:**  
   - Group all JavaScript sections logically in the HTML.
   - Insert simple, clear comments to document the script logic and DOM manipulation.
   - Do NOT delete or alter any HTML/JavaScript logic (no functional changes).
   - Section JavaScript for: 
     - Modal handling for all three selectors
     - AJAX for saving/updating entities and summary logic
     - Tooltip logic (for question mark descriptions)
   - Ensure clarity for future maintainers and AI agents.

4. **No Code Removal:**  
   - Retain all debug lines and script logic as in the source (unless directed otherwise).

5. **Design Decisions:**  
   - The user chose to implement the recommendations as proposed without further customization.

---

**Completed Tasks:**
- All inline style code in assessment-details.html has been moved to the top of style.css and is clearly marked.
- style.css received new styles for button row and modal-button uniformity (`.choose-buttons-row`, `.modal-launch-btn`).
- The HTML for the three modal launch buttons is now unified and styled identically.
- Modal markup for the Org Services selector now matches the Users modal in layout and style. Button/UX harmonization for all relevant selectors is complete.
- JavaScript in assessment-details.html is now grouped by function, with new comments for modal logic, AJAX, answer saving, and tooltips.
- Comments were added for clarity (intended for maintainers/AI agents).

---

**Pending/Notes for Continuation:**
- All planned refactoring/standardization is complete as per user requirements.
- Debug blocks/console output remain; these can be flagged for removal at a later review if desired.
- The suggested changesets have been written/applied in this session (see filepaths above).
- No further manual changes are required unless additional UI, functional, or cleanup requests are received from the user.

---

**File References:**
- HTML/Thymeleaf template: `app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`
- CSS file: `app/src/main/resources/static/style.css`

**Current State:**  
- All primary requirements implemented. System is ready for further QA or for new feature/change requests.

---

**For later agents:**  
You may safely assume the UI and styling for selection modals and related buttons is now unified, and JS is logically grouped and documented. If code cleanup or removal of debug artifacts (such as debug blocks in HTML) is desired, please request further confirmation from the user. No changesets are currently left open.
