  the maturity answers presented in assessment-details miss the taking over of
  maturity answers from choosen org services. maturity answers for security
  controls should be greyed out if org service assessment spots the maturity
  answer.

**Session Summary for AI Agent Handoff**

---

**System Context:**  
The user is developing an application to handle assessments with security controls, maturity answers, and organization services (org services), using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and JPA. Core files involved are in `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/`, `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/organization/`, `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/maturity/`, and `app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`.

---

### **Key Requirements & Workflow Evolution**

1. **Show Maturity Answers Inherited from Org Service Assessments**
    - On `assessment-details.html`, if a security controlâ€™s maturity is answered via an org service, this answer should be prefilled and displayed.
    - Such answers must be greyed out (disabled for editing).
    - For clarity, the UI label must show the name of the originating org service instead of a generic string.

2. **Backend Logic**
    - In `AssessmentController.java`, the code must, for each linked org service, fetch its org service assessments and, for each applicable control with a given percent (`orgServiceAssessmentControl.getPercent()`):
        - Map the percent to the closest `MaturityAnswer` (by absolute difference).
        - If the security control is *not already answered directly* in the assessment, fill:
            - `controlAnswers` with the closest matching answer.
            - `controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName` (a `Map<Long, String>`) with the org service name.
    - This map is added to the model as `"controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName"`.
    - Debugging code logs the contents for validation.

3. **Frontend Logic (`assessment-details.html`):**
    - For each control:
        - The maturity select dropdown is disabled using:
          ```html
          th:disabled="${T(java.lang.Boolean).TRUE.equals(controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName[ctrl.id])}"
          ```
          (actually, the disabling should be determined by presence/non-null of the org service name map entry).
        - The label for any taken-over answer is shown via:
          ```html
          <span th:if="${controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName[ctrl.id]}"
                class="taken-over-label"
                th:text="${controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName[ctrl.id]}"
                title="Answer is taken from this Org Service"></span>
          ```
    - The CSS for `.taken-over-label` remains for visual identity.

4. **Defensive & Robustness Fixes**
    - Robust Thymeleaf expressions are used (null-safe and type-safe).
    - The controller always sets the map in the model, preventing null pointer errors.
    - The percent-to-answer mapping is closest-match, not exact, ensuring reliable UI behavior.

---

### **Decisions Made**

- Always show the org service *name* in the label beside greyed-out/inherited answers.
- Use closest percent-to-maturity mapping, instead of requiring an exact match.
- Use a `Map<Long, String>` for "taken over" org service names; label in UI is only shown if present.
- Defensive template logic to handle null/absent keys safely.
- Debugging output is included for backend mapping verification.

---

### **Implementation State & Outstanding Tasks**

#### **Completed**
- Backend mapping logic has been prepared and/or integrated to:
    - Correctly fill `controlAnswers` and `controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName`.
    - Always provide/initialize these in the model.
    - Log the mappings for backend verification.

- Template (`assessment-details.html`) is set (or staged) to:
    - Use the org service name map for disabling and labeling.
    - Use robust and safe Thymeleaf expressions for all lookups.

#### **Pending/To Validate**
- Ensure that all relevant points in the backend (especially multi-service scenarios or edge cases where multiple org services provide conflicting answers) are robust; currently, only the first answer is taken.
- Remove any now-unused legacy maps.
- Validate with real/fake data that the UI displays as intended: disabled select, prefilled answer, and correct org service name next to each inherited answer.
- If `orgServiceAssessmentControl.getPercent()` is not well-aligned with maturity model ratings, revisit/provide advanced mapping.

### **References (File Paths and Key Entities)**

- **Backend logic:** `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/AssessmentController.java`
  - Key methods: `getAssessmentById`
  - Maps: `controlAnswers`, `controlAnswerIsTakenOverOrgServiceName`
- **Frontend/template:** `app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`
  - Key select+label block: security control answer select, taken-over label
- **Org service link:** `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/organization/OrgServiceAssessmentRepository.java`, `findByOrgServiceId(Long)`
- **Maturity Mapping:** `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/maturity/MaturityAnswer.java`: field `rating`

---

### **Instructions for Next Agent**

- Review and validate backend logic around mapping percent to nearest maturity answer.
- Check robustness and clarity of model population, especially in multi-org-service scenarios.
- Test the UI with various assessments and org service configurations.
- If additional tweaks are needed (e.g. advanced conflict resolution, API endpoints, or UI interactions), continue directly from this stable and robust foundation.
