### Session Summary

#### Context:
- The session involves modifying a Java/Thymeleaf web application related to compliance checks, specifically the template located at `app/src/main/resources/templates/compliance-view.html`.
- The goal is to alter the presentation of compliance threshold evaluation results.
- The system's knowledge cutoff is June 2024.

#### Requirements & Decisions:
1. **Initial Request**:  
   The user requested the removal of the "status" row from Threshold Evaluations in `compliance-view.html`. There was initial confusion interpreting "status" as the visual "Passed?" column, which led to removal of the second column (“Passed?”).

2. **Clarification**:  
   The user clarified that the requirement is to remove a threshold corresponding to the **key "status"** from the displayed evaluation results in the table (i.e., **do not display a row where the rule key is "status"**), not just to remove the "Passed?" column.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The code in `compliance-view.html` was amended so that when displaying the `thresholdsDetails` map (which is iterated as `rule` in the template), any entry where `rule.key == 'status'` will not be rendered in the table.
   - This filtering is accomplished by wrapping the row content in a `<th:block th:if="${rule.key != 'status'}">...</th:block>`, ensuring no rows for "status" appear in the output.

#### Current Template State:
- The "Threshold Evaluations" HTML table now ONLY renders rows for threshold rules **except** where the rule key is exactly `"status"`.
- Visual presentation changes (removal of "Passed?" column, etc.) are completed.
- Exemplary filtering code:
  ```html
  <tr th:each="rule : ${details}">
      <th:block th:if="${rule.key != 'status'}">
          <td th:text="${rule.key}"></td>
          <td th:text="${rule.value} ? 'Yes' : 'No'" th:style="${rule.value} ? 'color:green;' : 'color:red;'"></td>
      </th:block>
  </tr>
  ```
- Any previous logic that showed a row for thresholds with the key `"status"` is now suppressed.

#### Pending Tasks / Next Steps:
- No additional changes are pending based on the user's last clarification. The displayed table should now match the requirement: **no row should appear in "Threshold Evaluations" for any threshold where key is "status"**.
- If further UX or backend changes are required (for example, changing how this data is provided, or similar filtering applied elsewhere), these have not yet been addressed.

#### Changeset State:
- The changes have been staged/applied to `app/src/main/resources/templates/compliance-view.html` but not committed or merged, based on the chat agent's workflow.
- No backend (Java) source code has been changed: all logic is implemented in the Thymeleaf template only.
- No test or further verification steps have been described or performed.

#### Unique References:
- `app/src/main/resources/templates/compliance-view.html`

#### For Future Agents:
- If you need to apply this logic elsewhere (e.g., in other templates or APIs), reuse the conditional rendering pattern above.
- If additional or related requirements arrive—for example, hiding keys with other names, re-adding or customizing the "Passed?" column, or extending backend filtering—coordinate with this logic for consistency.
- The requirements have been clarified as strictly about omitting `"status"` keys from the rendered evaluation table, not visual column changes alone.

**This summary should enable continued or related work by any AI agent familiar with Thymeleaf, Java web applications, or compliance UI requirements.**
