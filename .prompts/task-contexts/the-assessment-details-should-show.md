  the assessment-details should show maturity answers greyed out, if a org
  service that is assigned to the assessment has an org service assessment
  maturity answer for that. that works nicely - however only when a answer is
  choosen. this should change, so that maturity answers from org services are
  always greyed out even if user not yet choose an answer
---
**Session Summary**

### Context
This session concerns the behavior of the assessment details UI for an application tracking security control maturity answers at both organization and org service levels. The user wants the maturity answers from org service assessments to always appear as "greyed out" (disabled) in the UI if any org service assigned to the current assessment provides an answer for that security control. This should be true even if the user has not yet selected their own answer for that control. The system is a Spring Boot Java app using Thymeleaf templates.

### Requirements
- On the assessment-details page (`app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`), the maturity answer select for each control should be disabled (greyed out) if an assigned org service assessment has an answer for that control, regardless of whether the user selected an answer.
- The UI must show the org service's maturity answer as selected in the dropdown if no user answer is present, and the select should be disabled.
- The solution must only need Thymeleaf (server-side rendering) with no JavaScript (JS) intervention for the initial UI state.
- Debugging information should be available to confirm the context provided to Thymeleaf for each control.

### Implementation Summary

#### Backend (`app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/AssessmentDetailsController.java`)
- The controller was updated (applied) to:
    - Iterate assigned org services for the current assessment and check each control for an org service answer using percent > 0.
    - Map the org service percent to a `MaturityAnswer` based on its rating.
    - Produce three Thymeleaf model attributes:
        - `controlAnswerIsTakenOver`: `Map<controlId, Boolean>`, true if an org service answer exists for the control.
        - `controlDisplayAnswers`: `Map<controlId, MaturityAnswerId>`, set to the user answer if present, otherwise the org service answer.
        - `controlTakenOverOrgServiceName`: name of the org service (used for display, not crucial for greying/logic).
    - These are passed as model attributes to the view on initial page loads.

#### Frontend (`app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`)
  *Current status: changes not yet applied or confirmed as working*
- The answer select is rendered inside the Thymeleaf loop for each control:
    ```html
    <select ... 
      th:disabled="${T(java.lang.Boolean).TRUE.equals(controlAnswerIsTakenOver[ctrl.id])}"
      ...>
        <option>...</option>
        <option th:each="ans : ${maturityAnswers}" th:value="${ans.id}"
            th:selected="..." ...></option>
    </select>
    ```
- The `th:selected` condition was updated to type-safe comparison:
    ```html
    th:selected="${controlDisplayAnswers != null and controlDisplayAnswers[ctrl.id] != null} ? ${ans.id.toString()} == ${controlDisplayAnswers[ctrl.id].toString()} : false"
    ```
- A diagnostic debug comment was added above each select to show context:
    ```html
    <!-- DEBUG: ctrl.id=${ctrl.id}, takenOver=${controlAnswerIsTakenOver[ctrl.id]}, displayAnswer=${controlDisplayAnswers[ctrl.id]} -->
    ```
- User has been instructed to inspect this in browser dev tools to verify Thymeleaf context per rendered control.

#### Issue Observed
- After a reload, org service greying/selecting works.
- If the user picks an answer (via JS), UI does not update until reload (expected since only backend/Thymeleaf applies logic).
- Most crucial issue: for controls with no user answer but a matching org service, the greying/selection is **sometimes still not rendered** unless page is reloaded, or is not reflected even on first load; possibly due to Thymeleaf context/scope or key mismatch.

### Pending Tasks & Open Issues
- **Frontend (Critical, still open):** Confirm that the select is always disabled and org service answer is shown as selected if and only if `controlAnswerIsTakenOver[ctrl.id]` is true and `controlDisplayAnswers[ctrl.id]` is non-null. Use the debug lines in browserâ€™s DOM to verify that the Thymeleaf context matches expectations for problematic controls.
- **Backend:** Already outputs correct model attributes; if Thymeleaf inputs are correct but UI is not as expected, the template must be further debugged for scope or looping issues.
- **Next step:** User is to inspect generated `<!-- DEBUG: ... -->` comments in the HTML for a problematic and a working row, and if mismatches persist, report them so the mapping/looping issue can be precisely fixed. No JS changes are requested.

### Changeset Status
- `AssessmentDetailsController.java`: updated and applied, supplies correct data.
- `assessment-details.html`: debug enhancements and logic for type-safe answer matching proposed, some may be stale. Most recent action was to add the debug comment above each dropdown.

### AI Agent Continuation Guidance
- Await user inspection (or provide snippet) of `<!-- DEBUG: ... -->` output for a problematic case.
- If mapping is correct, but UI fails, inspect further for DOM or repeated loop issues.
- If mapping is not correct, adjust controller logic or template loop as needed.
- No further JS changes are to be made; solution must rely on server-rendered state.

**Session is in a "verify/debug frontend state mapping" phase.**
