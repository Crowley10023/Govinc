  i want do to assessments for org services. for this, a new entity
  orgserviceassessment is needed that holds the maturity answers of org services
  assessments. a new view is needed, org service assessment, that should open
  when selected in orgservice-edit.html with "assess". the org service
  assessment view should present all present security controls and allow two
  things: choose whether the security control is applicable to the org service
  and and answer as number in percent.

**Session Summary: Org Service Assessment Implementation**

---

### Requirements & Workflow

1. **Feature Goal:**
   - Implement an assessment system for organizational services, where users:
     - Can assess services against all available security controls.
     - Specify if each control is applicable and record a maturity percentage (0â€“100%).

2. **Entities:**
   - **OrgServiceAssessment**: Links to an OrgService and tracks assessment date and a collection of control answers.
   - **OrgServiceAssessmentControl**: For each SecurityControl, records applicability, percentage answer, and assessment reference.

3. **Repositories:**
   - **OrgServiceAssessmentRepository** and **OrgServiceAssessmentControlRepository**: Provide standard Spring Data JPA CRUD and lookup methods.

4. **Service Layer:**
   - **OrgServiceAssessmentService**: Supports finding, creating, and saving assessments (including pre-loading all security controls for a new assessment).

5. **Controller:**
   - **OrgServiceAssessmentController**: Handles:
     - GET: Loads or creates an assessment for a given OrgService and presents a form.
     - POST: Updates and saves the assessment, ensuring all required fields are set.

6. **UI/Views:**
   - **orgservice-edit.html**: Now contains an "Assess" button linking to the assessment page for the selected OrgService.
   - **orgservice-assessment.html**: Presents all security controls with inputs to set applicability and maturity percentage. The form includes required hidden fields for ID, orgService ID, and assessmentDate.

---

### Key Implementation Decisions

- Changed the `controls` collection in `OrgServiceAssessment` from `Set` to `List` for compatibility with index-based form binding in Spring MVC.
- Included a hidden field for `assessmentDate` in the assessment form to ensure the not-null constraint is always satisfied.
- Updated the controller to set the assessment date to `LocalDate.now()` if not present during save operations.
- Adopted best practices for initializing collections and form data binding.

---

### Bug Fixes

- **InvalidPropertyException**: Resolved by switching collection type to `List` for proper index-based binding.
- **DataIntegrityViolationException**: Fixed by adding a hidden `assessmentDate` input in the form and controller-side fallback.

### Task State & Pending Actions

- **All described code changes have been fully implemented and their status is "applied".**
- No open or pending code changes remain in this session.
- The system is ready for further enhancements, validation, or integration testing.
- Next step (if needed): Test the complete assessment workflow. If issues occur or new features are required, agent should proceed accordingly.

**Context for Future Agents:**  
All requirements for organizational service assessments have been addressed, including entity modeling, repository setup, service and controller logic, and UI updates. No unfinished implementation remains from this session. Continue with QA, user feedback, or additional features as needed.
