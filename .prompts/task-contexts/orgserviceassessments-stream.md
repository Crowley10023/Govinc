**Session Summary for AI Agent Handoff**

---

### Issue 1: `DataIntegrityViolationException` with `OrgServiceAssessmentControl`
- **Context:** An exception was thrown while saving `OrgServiceAssessmentControl` due to a null or transient `orgServiceAssessment` field.
- **Root Cause:** The field references a NOT NULL constraint in both the entity (`@ManyToOne(optional = false)` and DB).
- **Decision/Change:**  
  - Updated `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/organization/OrgServiceAssessmentService.java` so that, before saving an `OrgServiceAssessment`, its controls' `orgServiceAssessment` field is set to the owning assessment. This prevents saving controls with a null parent.
  - **Status:** Applied.

---

### Issue 2: `NoResourceFoundException` on `/orgservice-edit/2`
- **Context:** Spring attempted to find `/orgservice-edit/2` as a static resource, resulting in an exception.
- **Cause:** The URL was not handled by any controller mapping, causing fallback to static resource handling.
- **Decision/Plan:**  
  - Ensured `/orgservice-edit/{id}` is handled by a controller route.
  - Resolved by modifying view and controller mappings.

---

### Workflow Change: Save Action Behavior
- **Requirement:** After saving an Org Service Assessment, redirect the user to the Org Service's edit view rather than to the list.
- **Decision/Change:**  
  - Modified `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/organization/OrgServiceAssessmentController.java` so the `saveAssessment` POST action redirects to `/orgservices/edit/{orgService.id}` after save.
  - **Status:** Applied.

---

### UI/UX: Org Service Edit View Enhancements
- **Requirements:**
  - Use div-based tabular layout for the org service edit form.
  - Apply styling primarily via `main style.css`.
- **Decision/Change:**
  - Refactored `app/src/main/resources/templates/orgservice-edit.html` for div-based, modern responsive form layout and button groupings, leveraging (and compatible with) `main style.css`.
  - **Status:** Applied.

---

### UI/UX: Caption for Number of Applicable Maturity Answers
- **Requirement:** In the org service (assessment) edit view, display how many maturity answers (controls) are applicable as an information caption.
- **Decision/Change:**  
  - Count computed in controller (`OrgServiceAssessmentController`) as `applicableCount` (filtering controls by `.isApplicable()`), passed via model.
  - Caption rendered in `app/src/main/resources/templates/orgservice-assessment.html` as “Number of applicable maturity answers: ...”.
  - **Status:** Applied.

---

### Pending / Next Steps
- All discussed and requested changes above have been implemented and applied.
- **No open changesets are pending.**
- If further style harmonization with `style.css` or extension of caption logic is needed, further instructions are required.
- **System Context:** All changes follow Spring Boot conventions and target compatibility with Thymeleaf views. Entities follow JPA mappings, with focus on non-null integrity across relations.
