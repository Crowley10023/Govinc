**Session Summary – Compliance Service Logic and Requirements**

### Context/Codebase
- Java Spring application for compliance assessment, likely in a multi-level org unit hierarchy.
- Relevant files and classes:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceService.java` (`ComplianceService.ComplianceResult`)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/AssessmentControlAnswer.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/maturity/MaturityAnswer.java`

---

### Key Requirements, Fixes, and Decisions

#### Initial Build Failures & Variable Corrections
- Build failed due to missing variables in `ComplianceService.java` for overall (aggregate) statistics:
  - `totalControlsPossible`, `totalControlsAnswered`, `totalScoreSum`, `totalScoreCount`, and missing `round(double, int)` method.
- Patch provided and applied: Aggregate variables were declared/accumulated correctly; `round` was added.

#### Score Extraction for Answers
- Error: `AssessmentControlAnswer` lacked a proper `getScore()` method.
- Patch (applied): 
  - `AssessmentControlAnswer.getScore()` implemented to return the rating from `MaturityAnswer`. 
  - `MaturityAnswer.getScore()` also added for compatibility.

#### Coverage Percent/Frontend Expressions
- Thymeleaf EL failed resolving `coveragePercent`/`averagePercent` on compliance results.
- Patch (applied): Public getters/setters for these fields added to `ComplianceResult`; values are set during compliance calculation.

#### Correct Inclusion of Missing Assessment Data
- Requirement: Org units *without* assessments must count towards the denominator of overall score calculations and be treated as 0 for answered/score.
- Patch (applied): Units with missing assessments are handled as 0-answered, 0-scored, ensuring accurate aggregate statistics.

#### Org Unit Compliance Status - No Answers
- Requirement: A unit with zero answered controls (i.e., no recent or any supported assessment) must be marked non-compliant.
- Patch (applied): Compliance status now requires at least one answered control.

#### Propagation/Tree Aggregation of Compliance Status
- Requirement: A unit should be compliant *only if all children are recursively compliant*, regardless of its own answers.
- Patch (applied, reinforced): 
  - Compliance calculation now post-orders the org units and propagates compliance upwards strictly (parent is only compliant if all children are).
  - Compliance status for parents is recalculated based on children after initial assessment-based compliance.

#### Strict Scoring for Averages
- Requirement: Overall average percent must be calculated such that children/org units with 0 percent or missing score are counted as 0 in the mean (i.e., all org units included in divisor).
- Patch (applied): Calculation now includes all org units, assigning 0 to those with no answers for the average computation.

#### Multiple User Requests for Reinforcement
- The user repeated the directive that parent/overall compliance status must only ever be compliant if **all** children are compliant (never by “any” child being compliant). 
- The logic was patched more than once to reinforce this correct recursive, post-order compliance aggregation.

---

### Workflow/Change Status

**Patched & Complete**
- All issues reported by the user have patches applied.
- Compliance aggregation (status and scores) works as specified, both for individual org units and recursively across the org hierarchy.
- All relevant frontend properties are exposed; statistics account for missing or empty assessments.
- No further user actions are pending; latest state implements all requirements.

**No pending tasks. Change set is fully applied.**

### Useful References for Agents
- Main workflow: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/compliance/ComplianceService.java`
- Key model/helper classes:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/AssessmentControlAnswer.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/maturity/MaturityAnswer.java`
- If more adjustments are requested, start with recursive compliance calculation and relevant frontend properties.

**Session is ready to be continued for further logic, testing, or UI tasks.**
