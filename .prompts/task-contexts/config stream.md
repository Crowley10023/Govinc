  the current setup of the spring boot application is to load
  application.properties for database config. the configurationcontroller should
  be the controller to manage properties. i want to be failsafe in case the
  database connection is not properly set up. for this. introduce a check at
  application startup for the database connection. if the properties for the
  database are not giving a connectable database, start with a in memory
  database. the logic of changing the db setup is, that a button restart in
  database config allows the restart and subsequently use new database config.

### Session Summary

#### Requirements
1. **Failsafe Database Startup:** On Spring Boot startup, check database connectivity using configuration in `application.properties`. If connection fails, seamlessly fall back to an H2 in-memory database.
2. **Database Configuration Management:** The `/configuration/database` UI and `ConfigurationController` should allow:
   - Viewing/editing DB properties.
   - Attempting a DB connection check via a button.
   - Saving new DB properties, but only if a connection test is successful.
   - Restarting the application to apply new DB config after a successful test.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - "Approve & Apply" save button is disabled until connection check is successful.
   - Any errors during the DB connection check are shown to the user in detail.
   - "Restart" button triggers Spring Boot context/application restart after saving new DB settings.

4. **Security:** AJAX requests (such as the connection test) must include CSRF tokens to avoid “403 Forbidden” errors under Spring Security.

#### Changes & Implementation (State as of last interaction)

- **`DataSourceConfig.java`** (`app/src/main/java/com/govinc/configuration/DataSourceConfig.java`)
  - Implemented as a Spring `@Configuration` bean that attempts connection with user-specified properties; if unsuccessful, falls back on H2 in-memory.
  - **Current state: Patch applied and up to date.**

- **`DatabaseConfig.java`** (`app/src/main/java/com/govinc/configuration/DatabaseConfig.java`)
  - Now uses `@Component` and `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource")`, per best practices to avoid bean duplication.
  - **Current state: Patch applied and up to date.**

- **`ConfigurationController.java`** (`app/src/main/java/com/govinc/configuration/ConfigurationController.java`)
  - Enhanced with `/database/restart` POST endpoint for configuration-triggered restarts.
  - `/database/check` POST endpoint now returns detailed error messages for frontend display.
  - **Current state: Patch applied, but may be considered stale due to further required changes.**

- **`configuration-database.html`** (`app/src/main/resources/templates/configuration-database.html`)
  - Recently updated to:
    - Add a detailed-reporting "Check Connection" button.
    - Disable the save ("Approve & Apply") button until a successful connection is confirmed.
    - Show error details on failure.
    - Add a "Restart" button that hits the new restart endpoint.
  - **CSRF Fix Pending:** User was experiencing 403 Forbidden errors. The AI agent is/about to patch the template to:
    - Add Thymeleaf-exposed CSRF meta tags in the HTML.
    - Adjust AJAX JS (`checkConnection()`) to include CSRF header and token.
  - **Current state: Patch in progress for CSRF protection. Otherwise matches requirements.**

---

#### Decisions/Confirmed Actions

- All controller logic and properties management will be strictly failsafe: only allow database property changes if the connection can be confirmed.
- UI/UX should proactively guide the user, including clear display of backend errors.
- Security: All AJAX logic (check connection) must include CSRF headers.
- No code display is required for further patches, as per explicit user request; direct changes only.

---

#### Outstanding Tasks / Pending Actions

- **CSRF Patch for AJAX in Template:** 
  - Apply meta tags for CSRF token/header in `configuration-database.html`.
  - Upgrade JavaScript to read and apply CSRF values for all modifying POSTs, especially `checkConnection()`.

---

#### How To Resume

- If you are a subsequent AI agent, resume by finishing the CSRF patch in `app/src/main/resources/templates/configuration-database.html`, ensuring that the fetch request for `/configuration/database/check` includes the appropriate CSRF header and token using Thymeleaf-injected meta tags.
- Verify that all connection test logic and enables/disables for the submit button are working as required, with user-facing error details.
- After ensuring the patch is correct, proceed to test full configuration workflow (edit, check, save, restart DB config, observe fallback, etc.), then close the change set if all acceptance criteria are met.
