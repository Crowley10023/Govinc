  the current application takes its database configuration from
  application.properties. i want to change that so that in the navigation, there
  is a new navigation button "Configuration" that has two options: "Database"
  and "IAM". create a new template for database, have input fields for all
  properties that are currently in application.properties. for IAM, create also
  a new but for now empty template. be sure to integrate with current spring
  jpa. if possible, configuration should load dynamically after "approve".

**Session Summary for AI Agent Handover**

### Overview
This session involved enhancing a Spring Boot application to allow UI-driven management of database and IAM configurations. The primary focus was on providing a user-friendly web interface to update/configure database settings previously hardcoded in `application.properties`, with the possibility to check the DB connection, and ensuring config changes are handled correctly via the backend. All changes are in the context of a Spring Boot + Thymeleaf JPA application (`app/`).

---

### Requirements & Decisions

**1. Navigation & Template Changes**
- A new "Configuration" dropdown was added to the main navigation (`app/src/main/resources/templates/navigation.html`, status: stale) with two links:
  - **Database** (`/configuration/database`)
  - **IAM** (`/configuration/iam`)
- `configuration-database.html` and `configuration-iam.html` templates were created.
  - The database template includes a tabular form for all major DB config fields.
  - The IAM template is a stub, currently empty.

**2. Editable Database Config**
- Fields for database config mirror `application.properties`: `url`, `username`, `password`, `driverClassName`, `ddlAuto` (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`), `showSql`.
- A "Check Connection" button tests the current form settings against the DB; the result is shown inline (green check SVG or red error).

**3. Persistence & Spring Integration**
- A Spring-managed config class (`DatabaseConfig.java`) holds DB settings, annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`.
- `ConfigurationController.java` provides routes for the above templates, saving submitted changes in memory (not persisted to disk).
- Saving the form updates the in-memory `DatabaseConfig` instance; dynamic runtime JPA/DS reload is not implemented, but UI notifies the user.
- Controller ensures all fields, including `ddlAuto`, are mapped and updated.

**4. UI/UX Enhancements**
- The `ddlAuto` field is now a dropdown with options: none, validate, update, create, create-drop.
- The `showSql` field is a dropdown for true/false.
- The tabular layout improves clarity and reduces input error.
- The "Check Connection" feature POSTs form data to `/configuration/database/check` and gives graphical feedback.

**5. Bugfixes & Compatibility**
- Removed unused/incorrect Java imports from `ConfigurationController.java` (`javax.annotation.PostConstruct`, `javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory`), resolving build errors.
- Ensured the config form retains and handles the `ddlAuto` field like other properties.
- Minor: Made the config input names/values consistent.

### File Structure/References

- Navigation menu: `app/src/main/resources/templates/navigation.html` (**stale**, user may still need to merge).
- Database config template: `app/src/main/resources/templates/configuration-database.html` (**applied**).
- IAM config template: `app/src/main/resources/templates/configuration-iam.html` (**applied**, empty stub).
- Config class: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/configuration/DatabaseConfig.java` (**applied**).
- Controller: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/configuration/ConfigurationController.java` (**applied**).
- App properties: `app/src/main/resources/application.properties` (**applied**, mapped with env var fallback).
- UI dynamic JS in template for DB connection check.

---

### Current State

- **All major implementation changes for config UI and backend are applied, except** `navigation.html`, which is marked as stale—verify this change is applied/merged as needed.
- IAM config feature is stubbed; no business logic or form yet.
- DB config changes are in-memory only; persistence across restarts is not implemented.
- Dynamic DataSource/JPA runtime reload is not implemented (user notified in UI).

---

### Open/Pending Tasks

1. **Merge or verify update of `navigation.html`.**
2. **Persistence of database configuration across restarts.**
    - Presently only in memory; further work needed to persist to file or DB if required.
3. **Configure IAM settings UI & logic.**
    - IAM config page is an empty scaffold.
4. **(Optional): Implement live reload for DataSource/JPA if desired.**
    - Currently, user is notified that restart may be required.
5. **(Optional): User/requested enhancements to config workflow, e.g., confirmation prompts, logging, access control, etc.**

---

#### Additional Context
- The primary user is a developer, and the application’s audience/role is for administrative configuration of DB and IAM via UI instead of file-based property editing.
- All controller code expects correct form-field naming and model attribute names as per applied templates.
- Properties are currently loaded with fallback to environment variables for easy externalization.

**Ready for next agent to extend/continue based on above state. For seamless continuation, start by checking/merging `navigation.html`, and proceed with pending enhancement or implement persistent storage as needed.**
