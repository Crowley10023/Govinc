label: instead of "(taken over from Org Service) " show the org service name

**Session Summary (for AI agents)**

---

### Objective
Modify an assessment application so that when a control answer is "taken over" from an Org Service, the UI displays the Org Service's name, not just a generic label. Also, if no local maturity answer is set for an assessment control, nevertheless take the answer from the Org Service assessment.

---

### Key Requirements and Decisions

1. **Display Org Service Name:**
   - Old text: `(taken over from Org Service)`
   - New requirement: `(taken over from <Org Service Name>)`, where `<Org Service Name>` is dynamically inserted.
   - Display is only to be changed; no backend logic for answer selection/finalization is to be altered (confirmed by user).
   - If multiple read-only/answer tables exist, the change applies only to the primary display.

2. **Takeover Logic Update:**
   - If NO maturity answer is set for an assessment control, the application should nevertheless use the answer from the corresponding Org Service's assessment if available and applicable.

---

### Files Involved

- **Controller**: `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/assessment/AssessmentController.java`
- **Thymeleaf Template**: `app/src/main/resources/templates/assessment-details.html`

---

### Implementation Status

**Controller (`AssessmentController.java`):**
- [x] Added `controlTakenOverOrgServiceName` map: Maps `controlId` to the Org Service's name for each control whose answer is inherited.
- [x] Updated takeover logic to ensure that for any control without a local maturity answer, the application attempts to use the Org Service answer if present/applicable.
- [x] Added both `controlAnswerIsTakenOver` and `controlTakenOverOrgServiceName` to the model for Thymeleaf template usage.

**Template (`assessment-details.html`):**
- [~] Several attempts were made to replace the static text with:
  ```html
  <span th:if="${T(java.lang.Boolean).TRUE.equals(controlAnswerIsTakenOver[ctrl.id])}"
        class="taken-over-label" title="Answer is taken from an Org Service">
      (taken over from <span th:text="${controlTakenOverOrgServiceName[ctrl.id]}">Org Service</span>)
  </span>
  ```
- [~] The user confirmed only the display label should be changed, not finalization/read-only logic.
- [ ] There may be some lingering, less precisely targeted or duplicated replacements in the file due to indentation/whitespace mismatches (see history of changes to the template).

---

### Open Tasks / Pending Items

- [ ] **Confirm that stale or duplicate takeover label entries in `assessment-details.html` are resolved.** Ensure only the new dynamic form appears.
- [ ] **Validate UI**: After code changes, test to ensure the Org Service name appears correctly wherever answers are inherited, and not in static form.
- [ ] **Review Template**: Confirm there are no remaining instances of the static "(taken over from Org Service)" and that all are replaced by the dynamic version.
- [ ] **Further Clarification**: If a local answer is present but empty/blank, clarify if the Org Service answer should be used.

---

### ChangeSet State

- `AssessmentController.java`: **Applied** — Backend logic for dynamic Org Service name and takeover now implemented.
- `assessment-details.html`: **Some changes applied/stale** — Multiple replacement attempts; final clean/conflict-free template revision may be needed.

---

### Continuation Guidelines

- Review and clean up `assessment-details.html` for any duplicate or obsolete takeover label lines.
- Verify the integration by rendering sample assessments with and without local maturity answers, and with varying Org Service availability, to check correct display and data inheritance.
- If business rules around "empty" answers change, update both control logic and summary documentation accordingly.
