**Session Summary for AI Agent Handoff**

**Project Context:**
A Spring Boot/Thymeleaf application for managing security catalogs, security controls, and their assignment to domains. A controller and template allow catalogs to be edited; each catalog may reference zero or more security controls, and each security control belongs to a domain.

---

## Requirements and Decisions

### UI (Thymeleaf Template)
- The security control selection in `edit-security-catalog.html` must be grouped by "domain" (`SecurityControlDomain`).
- The selection UI should use a simple list of checkboxes (not `<select multiple>`), visually grouped for each domain, and allow for more spacing for usability.
- All security controls in the system must always be listed; controls not belonging to any domain should appear in a special "Unassigned" group.

### Backend (Controller)
- The controller must provide the template a list of all domains, each with their associated set of security controls as `securityControlDomains`.
- If any security controls are not assigned to a domain (their `getSecurityControlDomain()` is `null` or not in the list of domain IDs), those controls must be collected into a synthetic 'Unassigned' `SecurityControlDomain` that is added to the list for rendering.
- The Thymeleaf template must use the property `securityControls` (not `controls`) on each domain object to list the controls.

### Fixes Applied
- The controller (`app/src/main/java/com/govinc/catalog/SecurityCatalogController.java`) was updated:
    - Now injects `SecurityControlDomainService` and provides `securityControlDomains` to the template.
    - Helper method groups all controls by domain and handles "Unassigned".
    - `edit` and `create` endpoints both use this grouped view model.
    - `save` endpoint accepts a list of checked control IDs, fetches the corresponding entities, and updates the catalog.
- The Thymeleaf template (`app/src/main/resources/templates/edit-security-catalog.html`) was updated (but note: this change is not confirmed applied in the source):
    - Switched from `<select multiple>` to a grouped list of checkboxes.
    - Uses `domain.securityControls` for domain grouping.

### Issue Fixed
- Fixed a Thymeleaf error: `"domain.controls"` failed because the correct property is `domain.securityControls`.

---

## Current State

- The backend logic in `SecurityCatalogController.java` for grouping controls by domain (including "Unassigned"), as well as proper population of the model for `edit-security-catalog.html`, is applied and active.
- The template update for grouped, spaced checkboxes referencing `domain.securityControls` is ready in the suggested changeset (status currently stale, presumed NOT yet applied to the working copy).

---

## Pending Tasks / Next Steps

1. **Confirm/Apply Template Update**
   - File: `app/src/main/resources/templates/edit-security-catalog.html`
   - Ensure the applied template renders checkbox lists grouped by domain, using `domain.securityControls`.

2. **Further Enhancements (if requested):**
   - Ensure that new or orphaned (unassigned) controls are correctly shown under "Unassigned" in all cases.
   - Add UI/UX improvements if needed (e.g., sorting, filtering).

3. **Testing**
   - Test with catalogs where some controls have no domain.
   - Confirm that saved assignments persist and round-trip.

## Unique References

- **Controller logic:** `app/src/main/java/com/govinc/catalog/SecurityCatalogController.java`
- **Template:** `app/src/main/resources/templates/edit-security-catalog.html`
- **Domain Model:** `SecurityControlDomain` (must have a public `getSecurityControls()` returning the associated set)
- **All security controls fetched via:** `SecurityControlService.findAll()`
